# brain_tumor_using_CNN

Recent technology development plays an important role in medical field for early identification and classification of different diseases that cause death and brain tumor is one of the major disease which cause death. Brain tumors grow when unregulated and undesired cells begin to grow fast and continuously. There are various image classification techniques such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography Scan (CT), and Ultrasound image (UI) are used to detect tumors in the human brain but especially MRI images are used in this work. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), VGG16, VGG19, MobileNet, ResNet101, Xception and EfficientNet are some of the approaches and architectures that have been compared in this study.
